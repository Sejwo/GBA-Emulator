STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT

Hopefully I finish it before I need to start writing my master's thesis so for now updates will be regular, don't know about the future. (paused for master's thesis after all)

I've seen some other projects like this, others focused more on the pure ARMv7 architechture if I borrow something it's from:

https://github.com/vnd/rarm

https://github.com/mcdoll/armv7

Also some other sources I regularly use for debugging, testing and overall learning for this project are, also when time comes for trying to run any actual GBA code here these will be my go-tos:
