STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT
Hopefully I finish it before I need to start writing my master's thesis so for now updates will be regular, don't know about the future.

I've seen some other projects like this, others focused more on the pure ARMv7 architechture if I borrow something it's from:

https://github.com/vnd/rarm
https://github.com/mcdoll/armv7

Also some other sources I regularly use for debugging, testing and overall learning for this project are:

https://mariokartwii.com/armv8/
https://armconverter.com/

Currently the code supports following instructions:
ORR
ADC
ADD
AND
BIC
CMN
CMP
EOR
MOV
SBC
SUB
MVN
RSB
