src//cpu_instructions//instruction_decoding.rs::Instructions // add instruction as 3 letter shortcut + Immediate/Register
src//cpu_instructions//all_instructions_arm.rs::Cpu // add the function to the impl block(probably terrible solution because all need to be public, but for clarity and to not pass Cpu as an argument that was nescessary)
src//cpu.rs::Cpu.interpret_instruction() // add the function from the impl block to the match case, again, slightly slower than it could be but nescessary for clarity as instructions grow larger
src//cpu_instructions//instruction_decoding.rs::decode_arm // finally add the opcode or other match code that is needed to assign this instruction
